## [2026-08-02] - Canonical Frontend Design Consolidation

### Added

- Added a six-mode design router for product, marketing, data, editorial,
  commerce, and justified immersive work.
- Added the weighted context-fit decision rubric, explicit hard gates, compact
  workflow, complete state model, and current responsive and performance
  verification criteria.
- Added canonical agent metadata and retained the Apache-2.0 and GitHub MIT
  license texts plus provenance and modification notices for the consolidated
  source material.

### Changed

- **BREAKING:** Consolidated the removed `frontend-skill` and
  `premium-frontend-ui` behaviors into `frontend-design`; use
  `web-design-reviewer` separately for post-implementation visual QA.
- Rewrote `SKILL.md` from 867 lines into a concise, context-first workflow
  that treats visual style and advanced effects as conditional choices.
- Replaced the oversized component tutorials with a focused WCAG 2.2
  checklist while retaining the local contrast checker.
- Marked the adapted OpenAI art-direction material as modified under
  Apache-2.0 and preserved the original local MIT terms.

### Fixed

- Removed broken contrast and modal examples, malformed headings, corrupted
  review text, and generic framework code that duplicated specialized skills.
- Corrected the 60-30-10 rule from a universal claim to an optional heuristic.
- Distinguished the WCAG 2.2 AA 24-by-24 CSS-pixel target-size requirement
  and its exceptions from the stronger 44-by-44 enhanced recommendation.
- Replaced mandatory premium effects and dependencies with accessible,
  measurable, and performance-bounded optional techniques.

## [2026-04-04] - Cross-Client Portability Refresh

### Changed
- Added a standard portability note covering GitHub Copilot, Claude Code, Codex, and Gemini CLI.
- Clarified that the core workflow does not require a dedicated MCP server and can run with local tools alone.

## [2026-03-09] - Workspace Modernization
